In our example it only takes 4 seconds.\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nAnd Congrats you got annotated data. The results will be stored in the folder results for your futher analysis. You will find a .csv file named like GeoMagResult_+name_of_your_csv_file_trajectory.\n\n7.1 Run MagGeo using your data.\nIf you are ready to annotate your GPS trajectories. You need to update the parameters file in MagGeo to let the program know what are the correct values of your data.\n\nCopy the csv file with your trajectories into the data folder.\nOpen and Update the following parameters in the file default.yml located in parameters folder:\ngpsfilename: \"name_of_your_trajectory.cvs\" Include the name of your Input data. The GPS trajectory you need to annotate with the geomagnetic satellite data.\nLat: \"latitude_column_name_in_your_trajectory\"\nLong: \"longitude_column_name_in_your_trajectory\"\nDateTime: \"Date_Time_column_name_in_your_trajectory\" make sure you have one column that includes Date and Time values together.\naltitude: \"altitude_column_name_in_your_trajectory\" if you do not have any altitute column, you can leave that in blank, including only \"\"\n\nSave your changes, return to the Terminal and run:\npython MagGeo_main.py -p parameters/default.yml --token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
